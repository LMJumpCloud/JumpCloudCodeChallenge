# JumpCloud Code Problem

## Tools:
- Only using packages available in the golang standard libarary

## Challenges

Being limited to the standard library has made certain aspects of this project very challenging
- Historically, I have worked with libraries such as `gorilla/mux`, which handle things like path parameters in a very clean and straightforward way
